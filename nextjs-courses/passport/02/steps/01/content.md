# Understanding Passport Authentication Flow

In this step, we'll review the Immutable Passport authentication flow and understand how to properly manage user sessions.

## Authentication Flow Overview

Immutable Passport uses OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect standards to authenticate users. Here's how the flow works:

1. **Initialization**: Your application initializes the Passport client
2. **Login Request**: User clicks login, triggering a redirect to Immutable's authentication service
3. **Authentication**: User authenticates with Immutable (first time only)
4. **Authorization**: User approves the requested permissions
5. **Redirect**: User is redirected back to your application with an authorization code
6. **Token Exchange**: Your application exchanges the code for access and ID tokens
7. **Session Established**: Your application creates a session using these tokens

## Challenges with Web3 Sessions

Unlike traditional web applications, Web3 apps face unique session management challenges:

- The user's wallet address serves as their identity
- Sessions may need to include blockchain-specific information
- Applications often need to track both authentication state and wallet connection state
- Managing token expiration and refresh flows

## Best Practices

For effective session management with Passport:

1. **Store relevant data**: Save ID token, access token, and user information
2. **Implement persistence**: Use localStorage, cookies, or server-side sessions
3. **Handle token expiration**: Implement token refresh logic
4. **Create authentication context**: Make auth state accessible throughout your app
5. **Implement loading states**: Handle authentication states during page loads

In the next steps, we'll implement these practices in our Next.js application.
